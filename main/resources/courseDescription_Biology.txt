"Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms, including their physical structure,
chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development and evolution. 
Despite the complexity of the science, there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it into a single, 
coherent field. Biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, 
and evolution as the engine that propels the creation and extinction of species. Living organisms are open 
systems that survive by transforming energy and decreasing their local entropy[2] to maintain a stable and 
vital condition defined as homeostasis."
