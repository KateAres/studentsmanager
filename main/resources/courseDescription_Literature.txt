"Literature, most generically, is any body of written works. More restrictively, literature refers to writing
considered to be an art form or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due 
to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage.

Its Latin root literatura/litteratura (derived itself from littera: letter or handwriting) was used to refer 
to all written accounts. The concept has changed meaning over time to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature), 
and non-written verbal art forms. Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution 
and proliferation of written works, culminating in electronic literature."
